## How to run the odysseus / scrap / vk utilities?


For example, you can do it like this

- Download the repository to `c: \ bin \ odysseus`
- Create a new environment variable `ODYSSEUS = c: \ bin \ odysseus`
- Also add `c: \ bin \ odysseus \ cmd` to the environment variable` PATH`
- If the system does not have the Racket programming language installed:
  - [download Racket] (https://racket-lang.org/download)
  - install Racket (for example, in `c: \ bin \ racket6.6`)
  - add `c: \ bin \ racket6.6` to the environment variable` PATH`
- For more convenient work in the windows console (formatted output, copy-paste, etc.), it is recommended to use [ConEmu] (https://conemu.github.io)

After that, the vk utilities should be run from the console in any directory.

To find out what keys and options are available, type `vk-users -h` and` vk-groups -h`
